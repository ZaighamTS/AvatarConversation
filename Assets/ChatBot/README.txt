IMPORTANT NOTE:
To activate OpenAI, you need to create a txt file in Assets/Resources folder and name it "openai_key.txt" (if not already present)
Paste the OpenAI API Key in there and save it.
Because the API key needs to be a secret DO NOT UPLOAD THE KEY ON GITHUB or it will be deleted or banned
Add the "openai_key.txt" in .gitignore
Place the following the the .gitignore file:

# Ignore API key in Resources
Assets/Resources/openai_key.txt
Assets/Resources/openai_key.txt.meta

Save it.
Make sure the txt file isn't being uploaded on git.
!!!!DO NOT PASTE THE OpenAI API Key ANY WHERE ELSE!!!!
